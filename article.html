                        Prime Minister holds talks to discuss new 3 tier system
                    </h1>
                        <h3 id="tierOne">
                            Tier One
                        </h3>
                            <p> 
                                Tier one restrictions is going to be similar to what is already in place for most of England.
                                That means a 10pm curfew for bars, pubs and hospitality. In addition a ban on gatherings of more than six people.
                                Most shops and services will remain open, with the need to wash your hands, or use sanitiser, wear face masks and keep to social distancing measures.
                                The threshold for tier one is likely to be around where coronavirus cases are fewer than 100 per 100,000 people or 0.1 per cent of the population.
                            </p>
                        <h3 id="tierTwo">
                            Tier Two
                        </h3>
                            <p>
                                When the number of cases starts to increase, and transmission cannot be held back through local responses, areas will be moved up to tier two.
                                In this case there are now more than 100 cases per 100,00 of the population.
                                Households will be banned from mixing inside venues, although they may be allowed to congregate in a private garden as long as the rule of six and social distancing are followed.
                                Other measures introduced when an area escalates to tier two have not yet been confirmed as the prime minister has no idea. (see buffoon)
                            </p>
                        <h3 id="tierThree">
                            Tier Three
                        </h3>
                            <p>
                                Tier three which is the harshest restrictions, will be in effect when tier two standards have been ineffective at containing the transmission of the virus - or where there has been a massive spike in infection rates.
                                The threshold for entering tier three lockdown has not yet been released (as the government has no idea (see buffoons), but has been described as "significantly higher rates of infection".
                                Bars, pubs, casinos, restauraunts, cafés, nail parlours and barbers could all face shut down along with some other local shops and service businesses.
                                Though details have not yet been confirmed (nor will they be), it is said people living under the toughest restrictions will be told to avoid all non-essential travel and remain locked in their area.
                                It is speculated that places such as Nottingham, which has England's highest rate of infections at 830 per 100,000 will be put into tier three straight away.
                                Knowsley, in Merseyside and Liverpool in general also faces tier three restrictions with a rate of 669.5 and 598.5 respectively.
